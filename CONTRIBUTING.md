# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need your help to make this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us on Slack ([#forum-acm](https://coreos.slack.com/archives/CTDEY6EEA) - private RedHat only link at this time). We want to help answer your questions about the `Open Cluster Management` organization.

For documentation, please see our [docs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/1.0/).
